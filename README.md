# NeuronGraph #
The implementation of neuron network training in the form of graph.
***
### Features
* Apply the graph to simplify the code.
* OOP coding.
* Features from [NeuronS](https://github.com/AdamQinwt/NeuronS).
### To be done
* Implement multithread computations.
* Bmp processing.
* Scripts.
### Always doing
* Implementation of matrix operations.
* Implementation of various optimizers.
* Implementation of different types of neurons.
## Now available
### Neurons
* Constant
* Variable(Trainable)
* FC(Fully connected)(To be tested)
* CONV(convolution)(To be tested)
* MAX_POOL(max pooling)
* ADD
* AL2(get x times ||input||)
* ADELTA2(get x times ||in[0]-in[1]||)
* Cross Entropy(get CE(in[0],in[1]))
### Optimizers
* SGD
* AdaGrad
* RMSProp
* Adam
* Conjugate Grad(2 versions)
